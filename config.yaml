      I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Howard University in Washington, DC, with a strong passion for leveraging Machine Learning to better understand human language and enhance communication. My doctoral research focuses on the relationship between hate speech and fake news, with the aim of designing robust and explainable AI systems for detecting and mitigating these societal challenges effectively and transparently. Throughout my academic journey, I have collaborated on projects with leading organizations, including Amazon, Google, the Us national Geospcail Agency, and Virginia Tech with work published at top [AI venues](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XPwyeRYAAAAJ&hl=en). 
      I have served as conference reviewer for the 
      [Black in AI 2024](https://www.blackinai.org/); [Women in Machine Learning 2024](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/affinity-workshop/66602), and Currently serve as Progam committee member for [Towards a Safer Web for Women](https://tsww25.github.io/) at [WebConf 2025](https://www2025.thewebconf.org/) workshop.
      I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant for the Center of Excellence in AIML [CoE-AIML](https://www.dod-coe4ai-ml.org/) 
      advised by [Dr. Danda Rawat](https://www.rawatonline.com/).
